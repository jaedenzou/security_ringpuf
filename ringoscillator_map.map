WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net not_out<10> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     1 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         12 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       12 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              12

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     4 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           12
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of      12   91%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      12    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           1 out of      12    8%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         3 out of     640    1%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.08

Peak Memory Usage:  4843 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  55 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   45 secs
